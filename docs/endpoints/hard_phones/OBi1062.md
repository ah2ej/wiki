# Setting Up an OBi 1062 Adapter with Hams over IP

Here is how get your OBi 1062 working, Keep in mind this phone and all OBI phones are EOL and no support besides self support. 

## Logging in to the Device

I already have another VoIP service configured, so I will be configuring what the device calls **Service Provider 2** (or sometimes "B").

When using the built-in Web server, you will find that almost all advanced options are greyed out until you un-check that row's Default checkbox.

## Service Provider Profile Configuration

On the left-hand side, under **Service Providers**, click on **ITSP Profile B**.

Under the General section:

* Name: Hams over IP
* SignalingProtocol: SIP

SIP section:

* ProxyServer: `pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com` (or your server name)
* ProxyServerPort: `5160`
* ProxyServerTransport: `UDP`
* OutboundProxy: `pbx-us1.hamsoverip.com` (or your server name)
* OutboundProxyPort: `5160`
* RegisterExpires: `3600`
* X_SessionRefresh: unchecked
* X_LineSeizeSubscribeExpires: `30`

## Voice Service Configuration

Under the **Voice Services** heading, click on **SP2 Service**.

* Enable: checked
* X_RegisterEnable: checked
* X_UserAgentPort: `5081`
* AuthUserName: your extension
* AuthPassword: your password
* URI: (blank)
* X_EnforceRequestUserID: checked
* X_SRTP: `Use SRTP When Possible`

Under **CallerIDName**, enter your caller ID as you want other people to see it.  I used my full name and call sign.  I'm not sure if HoIP overrides this setting or not.

## That's it!

Finally, reboot the device and see if the extension will register.  Now, pick up whatever telephone you've plugged into your ATA and see if you get a dial tone!

![Yes, this Western Electric 2500DMG now supports VoIP calling!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19931245/231046451-33b4da9a-7c52-47d4-bdb7-96ecfef54618.jpg)
(Yes, this 50-year-old phone actually works with HoIP!  The OBi ATA is under my desk and not pictured.)
